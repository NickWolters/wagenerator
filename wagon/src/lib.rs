//! WAGon is a Library/Ecosystem/Proof-of-Concept for working with Weighted Attribute Grammars.
//! WAGon is designed for researchers and language designers experimenting with WAGs such that they do not have to waste time creating a DSL and parser
//! and can start immediately experimenting with the format itself.
//!
//! You can read the [paper](../paper.pdf) which explains more in detail what WAGs are, what WAGon is and why you should care.
//!
//! WAGon consists out of the following crates:
//!
//! * [`wagon-parser`](../wagon_parser/)
//! * [`wagon-codegen`](../wagon_codegen/)
//! * [`wagon-lexer`](../wagon_lexer/)
//! * [`wagon-value`](../wagon_value/)
//! * [`wagon-utils`](../wagon_utils/)
//! * [`wagon-macros`](../wagon_macros/)
//! * [`wagon-ident`](../wagon_ident/)
